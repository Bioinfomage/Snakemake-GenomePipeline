# Snakemake-GenomePipeline
Snakemake-GenomePipeline is a scalable and reproducible workflow for genome analysis using the Snakemake workflow management system. This pipeline is designed to automate the key steps of processing sequencing data, including read alignment, BAM file sorting, indexing, and variant calling, from raw FASTQ files to high-quality VCF outputs.
